This project involves building a semantic personal profile page using HTML5.
The page structure is created manually using the HTML5 boilerplate, including the DOCTYPE, html, head, and body elements to ensure proper browser rendering.

Semantic elements such as header, nav, main, section, article, and footer are used to logically divide the content, improving readability, accessibility, and SEO. Internal navigation is implemented using anchor links to allow users to quickly jump between sections like About, Education, Skills, and Contact.

A profile image is included using the img tag with an appropriate alt attribute to support accessibility for screen readers. Lists (ul, li) are used to represent skills clearly, and contact information is placed inside the address tag to follow semantic correctness.

Overall, this project demonstrates an understanding of semantic HTML, clean code practices, and accessible web design, which are essential for modern web development.
